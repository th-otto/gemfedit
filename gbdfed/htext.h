"\n"
"The main window of each font editor is called the "
"Font Grid. All of the Font Grids have a special "
"clipboard used for passing glyphs around. This "
"clipboard is called <b>FONTGRID_CLIPBOARD</b>.\n"
"\n"
"At the top of each editor window there are some "
"fields and buttons. These are:\n"
"\n"
"<margin>The <b>Font</b> text field is where the font name "
"is set so it can be edited.</margin>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>The <b>Glyph</b> field is a label that provides "
"some information about glyph name, encoding, and "
"metrics when a glyph is selected. When a range "
"of glyphs are selected, this field displays the "
"start and end codes of the range.</margin>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>The push buttons are used to navigate through the "
"glyph pages. The <b>Previous Page</b> and <b>Next Page</b> "
"buttons normally skip glyph pages that are empty, "
"but that can be changed using the <b>Setup</b> dialog.</margin>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>The <b>Page</b> field indicates the current glyph page "
"and also allows a specific page number to be entered. "
"Once a page number is entered, pressing the Return "
"key will cause the Font Grid to shift to that page. "
"The page number entered is expected to be a decimal "
"number.</margin>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>The <b>Code</b> field is provided for situations where "
"the page number is not known, but the encoding is "
"known. The encoding entered in this field must be "
"in the base (8, 10, or 16) that is currently being "
"used to display glyph encodings (see the \"View\" "
"menu below). Once the encoding is entered, pressing "
"the Return key will cause the Font Grid to shift to "
"the page containing the encoding.</margin>\n"
"\n"
"When a glyph has been modified either by the user or "
"by automatic metrics corrections when the font is loaded, "
"the glyph code above the glyph cell will be highlighted.\n"

"\n"
"<margin>Insert Mode or Overwrite Mode</margin>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>This affects the way glyphs are pasted in the "
"Font Grids.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>The default mode, Overwrite, will simply replace "
"everything in the range of the glyphs being pasted "
"from the <b>FONTGRID_CLIPBOARD</b>.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>If Insert Mode is on, then all glyphs from the "
"insert point forward are shifted forward to make "
"room for the glyphs being pasted. Since this shift "
"changes the encoding of the glyphs moved forward, "
"it is possible for glyphs to get encodings greater "
"than the maximum for BDF fonts (65535). If this "
"happens, then the glyphs that have encodings greater "
"than 65535 are moved to the unencoded area and are "
"accessible by switching to the unencoded pages with "
"\"Ctrl+E\".</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>Correct Metrics, Keep Unencoded, Keep Comments, "
"Pad Character Cells, and EOL.</margin>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>If <b>Correct Metrics</b> is set, certain metrics will be "
"adjusted when a BDF font is loaded. If this option "
"is not set, then the editor will assume the metrics "
"are correct.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>If <b>Keep Unencoded</b> is set, glyphs with an ENCODING "
"value of -1 will be stored in the unencoded pages "
"which are accessible by switching using \"Ctrl+E\". "
"If this is not set, then unencoded glyphs will be "
"ignored when a BDF font is loaded.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>If <b>Keep Comments</b> is set, then comments collected will "
"be stored with the font and written out before the "
"PROPERTIES section of the BDF font. Comments can be "
"edited with the Comment editor invoked with \"Ctrl+M\". "
"If this is not set, then comments are simply ignored "
"when the BDF font is loaded.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>If <b>Pad Character Cells</b> is set, then character cell "
"fonts will have all glyphs padded with zero bits "
"until they fit the font bounding box exactly. "
"If this is not set, then the bitmaps for each "
"glyph will be clipped to the minimum rectangle "
"needed to hold the bitmap.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>The EOL menu sets the end-of-line string used "
"when BDF fonts are saved. The three most common "
"options are provided: Unix, DOS, and Mac EOLs.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>Point Size, Horizontal and Vertical Resolution</margin>\n"

"<margin1>These fields allow these three values to be set "

"OpenType fonts when they are imported.</margin1>\n"

"<margin>Proportional, Monowidth, and Character Cell</margin>\n"

"<margin>Update</margin>\n"

"take affect.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>Save Setup</margin>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>This button will become active after the Update "
"button was pressed to actually change the setup "
"options. Pressing this button will write all the "
"setup values to a file in the home directory. This "
"file is called \".gbdfedrc\".</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>Color</margin>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>If the bits per pixel for new fonts is two or four "
"this button will invoke the color editor. This editor "
"allows adjusting what the different colors look like "
"on the current screen. These colors are really only "
"useful for testing with the current screen and may "
"actually look different on other screens.</margin1>\n"
"\n"

"between the colors for two and four bits per pixel.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>Close</margin>\n"

"<margin1>This closes the Setup dialog. If any changes were "
"made and not applied with Update (or saved), then "
"the changes are discarded.</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin>Other Options</margin>\n"
"\n"
"<margin1>This button opens another setup dialog to set "
"more options. The close button at the bottom "
"simply closes the window. These options are:</margin1>\n"
"\n"
"<margin2>Hint OpenType Glyphs</margin2> "
"\n"
"<margin3>If this option is set, the OpenType renderer "
"will use the hints in the font if they exist. "
"This can sometimes make clearer glyphs at small "
"point sizes.</margin3>\n"
"\n"
"<margin2>Unicode Glyph Name File</margin2> "
"\n"
"<margin3>This field is for setting the name of a file "
"in the Unicode Character Database format. This "
"file will supply glyph names from the file. "
"The \"Browse\" button allows a file to be "
"selected using a FileSelection dialog.</margin3>\n"
"\n"
"<margin3>The Unicode Character Database format is basically "
"a set of semi-colon separated fields on a single line "
"with the first field being 4 hex digits representing "
"the encoding of the glyph and the next field being "
"the name of the glyph. These are the only two "
"fields used by this editor. The entries in this "
"file are expected to be sorted in ascending order "
"by encoding.</margin3>\n"
"\n"
"<margin2>Adobe Glyph Name File</margin2> "
"\n"
"<margin3>This field is for setting the name of a file "
"in the Adobe Glyph List format. This file will "
"supply glyph names from the file.</margin3>\n"
"\n"
"<margin3>The Adobe Glyph List format is basically a set of "
"semi-colon separated fields with the first field "
"being 4 hex digits representing the encoding of the "
"glyph and the next field being the Adobe name of the "
"glyph. The entries are not expected to be in ascending "
"order by glyph code.</margin3>\n"
"\n"
"<margin2>Pixel Size</margin2> "
"\n"
"<margin3>This option allows the pixel size in the GlyphEditors "
"to be set to different sizes. This effectively zooms "
"the glyph in the editor. If this is changed and the "
"Update button is pressed, all open GlyphEditors will "
"be updated with the new value.</margin3>\n"
"\n"
"<margin2>Show Cap Height and Show X Height</margin2> "
"\n"
"<margin3>These two options can be set to make the cap height "
"and the x height lines show up in the GlyphEditors. "
"These will only show up if they are defined in the "
"font or are set using the property editor. If these "
"are changed and the Update button is pressed, all "
"open GlyphEditors will be udated to show the lines.</margin3>\n"
"\n"
"<margin2>SBIT Metrics</margin2> "
"\n"
"<margin3>This option toggles the generation of an SBIT metrics "
"file which can be incorporated into a OpenType font "
"using the SBIT utility provided by Microsoft.</margin3>\n"
