tos             the source for the editor, and a simple viewer
unix            the source for a simple viewer, using X11
win32           the source for a simple viewer, using win32
fonts/tos       Atari ST original system fonts (dumped from TOS ROM into
                FNT format using this tool)
fonts/emutos    System fonts in different encodings, used by EmuTOS
                for certain languages
fonts/gem       Some GEM fonts taken from http://www.deltasoft.com/downloads-gemworld.htm,
                for testing the byte-swapped format. Not all of them can be displayed.
tools           fnt2bdf.c: a small tool to convert font files to BDF; adapted from STonX


Known bugs:
- horizontal offset tables are not handled
- Width & height of the cells, as well as the number of characters
  cannot be changed once a font is loaded. You can export them to a txt
  file, edit that and import it back again to achieve that.
- Only the first 256 characters in a font are displayed (reading &
  writing works, though; also i haven't found any fonts yet that
  have more characters)
- Compressed fonts from GEM can be loaded, but are saved as uncompressed
